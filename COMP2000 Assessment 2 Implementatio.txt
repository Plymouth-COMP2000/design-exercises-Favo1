COMP2000 Assessment 2 Implementation 



Task:
You are required to produce an Android application for the Staff and Guest sides, which will interact
with a RESTful API and a local database. The application will allow staff to manage menu items and
reservations, and guests to browse the menu and make reservations. The user stories reflecting
requirements of both user types from the scenario are available in coursework scenario section at
the front of this document.

The details of the API are available in the API documentation (API_documentation.pdf) This file provides the root path and all available endpoints for the API. 

Your application must:
• Be implemented in Java using Android Studio.
• Handle all connections to the API in a worker thread to avoid blocking the UI.                                                               
• Support notifications based on user-defined preferences.
• Apply the design patterns and SOLID principles covered in the course.
• Build upon the UI designs produced in your previous assessment as a foundation.

The Graphical User Interface (GUI) should implement the functional requirements outlined in the
scenario for both user types and must be responsive for different mobile device screen sizes. You
MUST use Git version control with GitHub throughout your development process. You will be
assessed on appropriate and consistent use of version control. Use the GitHub Classroom set up
above for this module
