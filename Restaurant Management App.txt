Coursework Scenario: Restaurant Management Application

A restaurant chain wants to develop a mobile application to manage its restaurant operations more
efficiently. The app will have two user types: Staff and Guest. The staff side will allow restaurant
employees to manage menu items and reservations, while the guest side will enable customers to browse
the menu and make table reservations.

Both staff and guests must log in to access the application’s main features. The application will interact with
a RESTful API that provides secure access to the database of the app users via standard HTTP methods.
Menu and reservations should be managed locally on the device using local database (preferably SQLite).

The app should show notifications to inform users of relevant updates. For example:
• Guests get notified when their table booking is modified or cancelled.
• Staff receive notifications for new reservations and change of reservations.
• Users should also have the ability to turn notifications on or off and manage their preferences in
their account settings.

Staff Side
This side of the application is for restaurant employees who need to manage menu items and handle
customer reservations.

Functional Requirements – Staff
• As a staff member, I wish to add new menu items with details (name, price, and image).
• As a staff member, I wish to edit menu items when details change.
• As a staff member, I wish to delete menu items that are no longer available.
• As a staff member, I wish to view and cancel customer reservations.
• As a staff member, I wish to receive notifications when a new reservation is made.

Guest Side
This side of the application is for customers who want to browse the restaurant menu and make
reservations from their mobile device.

Functional Requirements – Guests
• As a guest, I wish to browse the menu items with details such as price, and images.
• As a guest, I wish to make a table reservation for a specific date and time.
• As a guest, I wish to edit or cancel my reservations.
• As a guest, I wish to receive notifications when my reservation status changes.

Additional Requirements
• The app must allow user authentication and role-based access control (staff and guest features
must be accessible only to their respective roles).
• Notifications should be customisable so users can choose which updates they want to receive.
• The application interface must adapt to different screen sizes and orientations.

Exercise 1: 5 marks
• Analyse the scenario to identify the context of use and the intended users of the system.

Exercise 2: 20 marks

• Design the user interfaces for the mobile application using a low-fidelity prototype (e.g., paper
sketches or basic digital wireframes).
• Include a storyboard to illustrate user interactions and task flows.
• Ensure the design follows the HCI principles covered during the semester.

Exercise 3: 30 marks

• Conduct a formative usability evaluation of the initial low-fidelity prototype of the application.
• Involve at least two representative users in the study.
• Use one of the testing methods discussed in the module, applying your knowledge to plan,
conduct, and document the evaluation.

Exercise 4: 15 marks

• Re-design the user interfaces based on feedback from Exercise 3.
• Clearly highlight and explain the changes made.
• Produce a final storyboard with a clear narrative describing each interface from the user’s
perspective.

Set Exercise 5: 30 marks

• Implement the final UI design in Android Studio to create a high-fidelity design for one type
of user.
• Use correct UI components to support future functionality.
• Include all pages/layouts for the final solution, but no back-end or functional Java code is
required at this stage.
